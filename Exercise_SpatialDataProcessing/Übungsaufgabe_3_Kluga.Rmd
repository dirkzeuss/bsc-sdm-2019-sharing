Spatial Data Progressing 
```{r}

library(raster)


#Create a map of Germany with the following features:

# - a raster background map showing elevation data

ele <- getData("alt", country = "DE", res=10)
#ele

plot(ele, xlab = "°East", ylab = "°North", main = "ELEVATION OF GERMANY IN METER")

# - a vector map showing the country boundary

de <- getData('GADM', country='DE', level=0)
de

plot(de, add = T)

# - use the vector map to clip the raster map

## already done in step 1 (with the "country = 'DE' " )

# - map point locations denoting the places of birth of all course participants (use a SpatialPointsDataFrame object with the correct CRS for this task),


x <- c(7.46529, 9.70196, 7.85029, 9.57223, 9.47974, 8.79666, 13.41321, 8.61212, 11.47152)

df_birth <- data.frame(x, y, row.names = z)
df_birth

birthplaces <- SpatialPointsDataFrame(df_birth, df)
plot(birthplaces, pch = 18, add = T)

# - map the three largest German cities and Marburg with different symbols, and get bonus points by adding a legend,      rivers, and other cartographic elements as well as the distances of the places of birth to Marburg.

x_cities <- c(13.404954, 9.99368, 11.57538, 8.76679)
y_cities <- c(52.52000, 53.55108, 48.13710, 50.80217)

df_c <- data.frame(z_cities)

cities <- SpatialPointsDataFrame(df_cities, df_c)
plot(cities, pch = 8, cex = 2, add = T)
plot(cities[4, ], col = "red", pch = 8, cex =2, add = T)

## legend 

legend(0.5, 49.5, legend = c("Biggest Cities", "Marburg", "Birthplaces"), col = c("black", "red", "black"), pch = c(8, 8, 18), pt.cex = c(2, 2, 1))

## for the other entries i had a problem in finding a way to link a R-Donwload in the script. I found a way to make it with manual downloads, but doing so my file is bigger then 2mb.
